When we first sketched the concept of a **Coding Ninjas**, the intent was simple: create a place where ideas could be transformed into production-ready experiences without the friction of traditional classroom constraints.

Fast forward to today and the Club spans five pods, six partner labs, and an alumni network mentoring students across three continents.

## What changed

- **Intentional Pods** — we moved from generic committees to focused pods for AI, Full Stack, Immersive Media, and Robotics.
- **Production Mindset** — every squad ships with docs, instrumentation, and core KPIs aligned to real stakeholders.
- **Mentorship Flywheel** — alumni and industry mentors now rotate in weekly, keeping our craft sharp and relevant.

## What’s next

We are investing in public showcases, open-sourcing our best playbooks, and extending mentorship to regional schools. If you're keen to collaborate or learn more, **join the Club** and help us design what’s next.
